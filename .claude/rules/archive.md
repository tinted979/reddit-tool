# The subreddit archive: dumps.js, hyparquet.js and tools/

Moved from CLAUDE.md (web app architecture and Subreddit dumps). Why it's built this way: docs/adr/0005 (which supersedes 0004).

- **`dumps.js`:** `DumpSource`: loads the archive manifest from `https://rpp-db.tinted979.dev` (checked as untrusted input: subreddit names, each file under its own `r/<key>/`, no cutoff more than a day past the page's clock), says which subreddits it covers (`covers`, and `subreddits()`, their names, for *Only subreddits in the archive*), and reads one author's timestamps from a Parquet file with hyparquet range requests. A read that fails, or runs over `READ_TIMEOUT_MS` (20 s) for a range request or a stage of a lookup, switches it off for the rest of the scan and cancels the reads still under way; it records whose file failed (`brokenSubreddit`) for the end-of-scan note, and failed lookups aren't retried (the next scan opens a new source). Stop throws `Aborted`. `open({ onRequest })` calls `onRequest` once per request sent to the archive server (the manifest, even when it gives no archive, and each range read), which `app.js` counts. `core.js` doesn't import it: `buildProfile(…, { dumps })` calls `covers`/`timestamps` and bumps `lifetimeReads` (and `lifetimeGaps`, when Arctic Shift filled a gap before the post) for the end-of-scan note.
  - **Tails:** `TailStore` (one per tab, from `app.js`) keeps each covered subreddit's activity after its files end, up to the posts scanned (counts stop at the post, docs/adr/0006), which `core.js`'s `fetchTails` adds with `addTail`/`endTail`. It keys each tail by the files' cutoff, so a new build starts afresh. `tailFrom` restarts an hour before where a tail was complete, with repeats dropped by id. `covers` reports how far each kind can be trusted: an hour (`DUMP_TAIL_MARGIN`, its own constant, not `core.js`'s `INGEST_LAG`) before the files' cutoff, moved forward to its tail (or the files' alone with `withTail: false`). `timestamps` returns file rows plus tail rows (file rows only up to that hour before the cutoff once there's a tail), and `threadRows` a thread's rows up to that same point from the optional `comments_by_link` file (keyed by `link_id` without `t3_`). Tail rows are untrusted API data: ones without an id, author or time, by deleted accounts or AutoModerator, from before where the files are trusted, dated more than a day past now, or already seen are dropped.
- **`hyparquet.js`:** a saved copy of hyparquet 1.31.1's bundled build (MIT). Don't edit it; update it by downloading a new `+esm` build as its header describes.

## Subreddit dumps

`.github/workflows/archive-sync.yml` runs hourly and brings each covered subreddit up to date on its own cadence in `tools/archive.json` (`ci-and-agents.md` has its jobs). `docs/archive-runbook.md` covers setup, imports, repairs, pausing, pruning by hand, the token, and updating rclone, duckdb and hyparquet.

Arctic Shift's per-subreddit dumps are served as static Parquet on Cloudflare R2 (`dumps.js`). For a covered subreddit the page takes "before" facts from the files plus a tail up to the post fetched once per scan (docs/adr/0005, 0006), and for a scan limited (`only`) to covered subreddits, lifetime counts too; only when those stop short of the post does it ask per user about the rest (timestamp searches for "before" facts, one `interactions` query for lifetime counts). Otherwise lifetime counts come from the API, since a subreddit's dump doesn't cover the rest of Reddit. For a post older than the files, the thread's commenters come from `comments_by_link` plus one search for the thread's comments since; for a newer post, from the API's comment tree. The page's privacy text (README and `index.html`) names the archive host; keep it true if what the page reads changes.

- `tools/build_dumps.py` (Python, DuckDB via `uv`) turns a subreddit's posts and comments JSONL into `posts_by_author`, `comments_by_author` (lowercase author, `created_utc`; sorted by author) and `comments_by_link` (`link_id` without `t3_`, author as written, `created_utc`), plus `manifest.json` (format version, and per subreddit the build directory and `posts_to_utc`/`comments_to_utc`, the cutoffs the files are complete up to: the newest item for a build from JSONL alone, or `--posts-through`/`--comments-through` when given). It keeps no text, drops deleted accounts and AutoModerator, and de-duplicates by id. Builds go in `r/<sub>/<version>/` and are never overwritten; only the manifest changes.
  - **`--splice DIR --cut C`** (the archive sync, docs/adr/0005): DIR is laid out like the archive (the live `manifest.json`, and the subreddit's build under `r/<key>/<version>/`).
    - The new build keeps each of that build's files' rows up to C and adds the fetched JSONL's rows after it, cleaned the same way. They meet at C, so nothing is in both, and no ids are needed (the files have none).
    - Its cutoffs are `--posts-through`/`--comments-through` (the fetcher's `complete_through`, both required), and its version is when it was built (`YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSSZ`).
    - The downloaded build is untrusted: its version, its paths (rebuilt from key and version, not followed), sizes and columns are checked first.
    - It refuses a cut after either live cutoff (a gap), a cutoff earlier than the live one, or one in the future.
    - With `--out DIR` the new build lands beside the old, and DIR's manifest becomes the live one with this entry replaced.
    - Tests: `tools/tests/test_splice.py`.
- **`tools/reddit_lake.py`** (Python, DuckDB and zstandard via `uv`) keeps a local copy of Arctic Shift's monthly dumps, all of Reddit, that's quick to query: the lake. `docs/archive-runbook.md` has the monthly routine.
  - **Layout,** under `--root`: `raw/` holds the dumps as downloaded (`RC_YYYY-MM.zst` comments, `RS_YYYY-MM.zst` posts, in any subfolders), never changed; `lake/comments/YYYY-MM/` and `lake/posts/YYYY-MM/` hold Parquet parts, each sorted by `subreddit_key` (lowercase) then `created_utc`, and `lake/months.json` records what's converted (lines, rows, malformed lines skipped, parts).
  - **`update`** converts each downloaded month not in the lake. The dumps are zstd with a 2 GB window, which DuckDB can't read, so a thread decompresses them (a 4 MB output buffer: the default runs at a sixth of the speed) into chunks of about `--chunk-mb` in `lake/.tmp`, and DuckDB turns each into a sorted part.
    - A month's kind is written as `<month>.partial` and renamed, then recorded, so a cut-off run is redone, never half-read.
    - A file that ends partway through a frame (still downloading) or isn't valid zstd is left out, and the rest go in; two copies of one file are refused; `.!qB`/`.part` files are reported as downloading.
  - **The lake's columns** (`COLUMNS`) keep the fields worth querying, text included, and each dump field is read as text and cast, since types vary over the years (`edited`: null, 0 for edited at an unknown time, else when). They leave out what can be rebuilt (permalink, name, `*_html`), the fetching account's own view (likes, saved, …) and fields that are always empty. `raw/` keeps everything, so a new column list is a rebuild (bump `SCHEMA`), not a download.
  - **`extract`** writes `r_<Name>_posts.jsonl` and `r_<Name>_comments.jsonl` (the download tool's shape, named as the subreddit spells itself), which `build_dumps.py` reads. It refuses a lake with a month missing between its first and last (or one with only comments or posts), and a subreddit whose first item is in the lake's first month, since a build records where it ends, not where it starts, and would pass for complete (`--allow-partial-history` when it began then; docs/adr/0008).
  - **`status`** lists what's in the lake, gaps, what to convert, and files still downloading; with `--releases` it reads Arctic Shift's download page for released months not downloaded, with magnet links.
  - Tests: `tools/tests/test_reddit_lake.py`, on small dumps compressed as the real ones are. The tools tests need `zstandard` (CI's `uv run` has it).
- `tools/fetch_subreddit.mjs` (Node 22+) fetches one subreddit's posts or comments after a time, for the scheduled sync (docs/adr/0005).
  - **How it asks:** the same search as Arctic Shift's download tool, `/api/{kind}/search?subreddit&after&before&sort=asc&limit=auto`, but with only the `fields` the build reads.
    - `limit=auto` is 100–1000 rows a page by the server's capacity (API README), so a page under 100 rows ends it (`iterAscending`'s `shortBelow`).
    - It goes through the page's `ArcticShiftClient` (its pacing and backoff): `delay` 1 s, one request in flight, `appTag` `reddit-post-profiler-archive`, a User-Agent, and a budget in pages.
  - **What it writes:** as JSON lines in the shape `build_dumps.py` reads, exactly the rows from `--after` to `complete_through`, with a result file beside them. `complete_through` is the second before `--before` once it reached the end; otherwise it's the second before its newest row, since that second may be incomplete. `--before` defaults to a minute ago (`SETTLE`) and may not be later.
  - **Untrusted rows:** only checked fields are copied.
  - **Errors:** an API error stops it with what it had (exit 3), with `busy` set for a busy or rate-limiting server or no connection. It never escalates.
  - **Tests:** `web/tests/fetch-subreddit.test.js`, against a fake API.
- Publishing one subreddit (the archive sync, docs/adr/0005) takes two steps, so that the token is held only by the second:
  - **`tools/check_upload.py merge-one`** (no token) merges `r/<key>`'s entry from a build's `manifest.json` into the live manifest, downloaded byte for byte. Every other entry stays as it is live, so a stale or partial `dumps/` can't change them.
    - It refuses: a version that's live or already in the publish log; a missing file, or a size that differs; a cutoff in the future, or earlier than the live one (unless `--allow-older`); a format change; and a publish log that doesn't check out.
    - It writes a bundle: `key`, `version`, `live.sha256`, the merged `manifest.json`, the build's three files, and `r/<key>/published.json`.
    - The publish log is `{format, subreddit, publishes: [{version, replaced, utc[, repair]}], pruned: [version]}`, oldest first, keeping its newest `LOG_KEEP` (1000); `pruned` appears once there are any.
    - **Pruning is planned here, per subreddit, at each publish:** the builds the log says were replaced at least `PRUNE_AFTER` (72 h) ago, never the live one or the new one, at most `PRUNE_MAX` (5), oldest first. They go into the log's `pruned`, so none is planned twice, and into the bundle's `prune` file.
  - **`tools/publish_build.sh BUNDLE`** uses rclone, curl, sha256sum and standard shell tools (coreutils, grep, sed, find) only, with no Node or Python. `RCLONE`/`CURL` can name fakes, which the tests use.
    - It treats the bundle as untrusted: regular files only, exactly the expected names, a key, a version and a sha256 matching strict patterns, and a manifest that names the new build, all checked before any rclone call.
    - Then, in order:
      1. the live manifest on R2 (read with rclone, not through the cache) still has the bundle's sha256;
      2. the build isn't on R2 yet;
      3. the build files go up (`--immutable`, cached a year);
      4. each file is range-checked through the public URL;
      5. the live manifest is checked again, then the new one goes up (5 minutes);
      6. the publish log (5 minutes);
      7. last, it deletes the builds in `prune` (`rclone purge`). The list is only a request, so it keeps:
         - a build the replaced manifest named;
         - a build the publish log on R2 doesn't record as replaced (`"replaced": "<version>"`) at least 72 h ago, by the `utc` of the publish that replaced it and the clock. That log is read at step 1, before this publish replaces it, so a bundle can't vouch for itself, and the grace doesn't rest on `merge-one` alone.

         A build that's already gone is fine.
         - It then lists `r/<key>/` and reports builds that are neither live nor in the log; those are never deleted automatically.
         - A failed prune fails the script after the publish stands.
       - The `prune` list itself is checked before any rclone call: at most 5 lines, each a version, not the new build, and not named by the new manifest.
    - Tests: `tools/tests/test_publish_one.py`, `test_publish_build.py` and `test_prune.py`.
- **`tools/lifetime_bench.mjs`** is the owner's benchmark for P8 of the archive plan: whether one `interactions` query gives the same lifetime counts as the two aggregates, per commenter. It passed on 2026-09-26, so full scans ask `interactions` first (docs/adr/0007); it's kept to check that still holds.
  - **Errors:** a busy or rate-limiting server stops it with what it has (exit 3), as does an API error while it reads the post and its commenters.
  - **What it asks:** both, for a post's commenters (`--post`) or given users (`--users`), with the same bounds as a scan (up to the post; `--years` for a window), alternating which goes first.
  - **How:** through the page's client, one request at a time, 1 s apart, with the page's `meta-app`. It stops at the first busy or rate-limiting reply.
  - **What it reports:**
    - agreement, ignoring the case of subreddit names, with what differs;
    - errors by kind;
    - latency and retries, over the users where both answered;
    - the P8b gate: at least 99% agreement, no slower, and no more retries.
  - **Tests:** `web/tests/lifetime-bench.test.js`, against a fake API.
- **`tools/archive_sync.py`** is the sync's build job, with no token. Its config is `tools/archive.json`: each subreddit's `cadence` (1h–7d) and optional `"backfill": "api"`, plus `overlap`, `repair_days`, `repair_every`, `budget` (pages per fetch) and `run_budget` (pages per run, every fetch together; ADR 0005's budget per run). Once a run's budget is spent, the subreddits left wait for the next run.
  - **`plan`** says what's due:
    - a sync once the cadence has passed since the live build (less 15 min of slack), cut at the older cutoff less `overlap`;
    - a repair once `repair_every` has passed since the last repair the publish log marks (`merge-one --repair`), cut `repair_days` further back, for caught-up subreddits only;
    - a first build from the start, for a subreddit not live yet that opts into `backfill`; others are skipped, to be imported.

    Caught-up subreddits go first, most overdue first.
  - **`build --out DIR`,** for each due subreddit in turn:
    1. downloads the live build through the public URL (the manifest and logs with `?check=`);
    2. runs `fetch_subreddit.mjs` for posts, then comments;
    3. splices;
    4. runs `merge-one` into `DIR/bundles/NN-<key>/`.

    It then writes `DIR/summary.json`.
    - Bundles chain: each is merged onto the manifest the one before leaves live, so they publish in order.
    - A busy server stops the fetching and keeps the bundles made; a failed fetch, splice or merge skips that subreddit.
    - Downloads over 512 MB are refused. `--only` and `--repair` must name the same subreddit if both are given.
    - Tests: `tools/tests/test_archive_sync.py`, with a fake public URL and a fake fetcher.
- Hosting: R2 bucket `rpp-db`, served at `https://rpp-db.tinted979.dev` (custom domain, proxied, with a Cache Rule making it eligible for cache). Its CORS policy is `tools/r2-cors.json`: GET/HEAD from the Pages origin and `localhost:8000`, `Range` allowed, `Content-Range`/`Content-Length`/`Accept-Ranges`/`ETag` exposed. If the page moves origin, add the new one there and in the bucket settings. R2 applies CORS after the edge cache (checked live): a cache HIT still gets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for the requesting origin only, with `Vary: Origin`. The bucket's `r2.dev` URL stays disabled so all reads go through the cache.
- Zone settings for this host: Smart Tiered Cache on (misses fill from an upper-tier colo rather than R2); minimum TLS 1.2 on the zone and the R2 custom domain; a Configuration Rule for `http.host eq "rpp-db.tinted979.dev"` turning off Browser Integrity Check (the new security dashboard has no threat-score Security Level left to lower), because a challenge page on a cross-origin `fetch` shows up as a CORS error, switches `DumpSource` off and sends the scan back to the API. For the same reason Bot Fight Mode is off (zone-wide on the Free plan; the zone serves only this host): it gave GitHub's runners a managed challenge, so the weekly `archive-check` workflow got 403s, and it could do the same to a visitor on a VPN or cloud network. The managed WAF rules, which block scanners, stay on. Before changing a zone security setting, check that a scheduled `archive-check` run still passes.
- `tools/upload_dumps.sh` first runs `tools/check_upload.py` against the live manifest and R2's build list: the uploaded manifest replaces the live one whole, so it refuses one that drops a live subreddit (unless `--drop KEY`), a new build whose `r/<sub>/<version>/` already exists on R2, the live version rebuilt with different files, a live subreddit's cutoff going backwards (unless `--allow-older`), or a format change (unless `--allow-format-change`). Then it uploads build files (`immutable`, a year, never replaced) and checks them with `tools/check_dumps.sh files`; only then does it upload the manifest (5 minutes) and run `check_dumps.sh manifest` and `cors`. A whole upload never deletes: old builds stay until removed by hand. `--only` goes through `publish_build.sh`, so it prunes as above. The rclone token is limited to Object Read & Write on the bucket and stays out of the repo.
  - **`--only KEY [--allow-older]`** publishes just r/KEY's build, the way the sync does, so a `dumps/` holding only that subreddit is fine. It downloads the live manifest and r/KEY's publish log (with `?check=`), runs `check_upload.py merge-one` and then `publish_build.sh`, then `check_dumps.sh manifest` and `cors`. The first upload of all still goes up whole.
  - `RCLONE`, `CURL` and `CHECK_DUMPS` name its programs. The tests (`tools/tests/test_upload_dumps.py`) pass fakes, and also set `RCLONE_CONFIG` to an empty file, so a real rclone reached by mistake has no remote to touch.
- `tools/check_dumps.sh` checks, reading public URLs only: that the live manifest is readable from the page's origin and no other, and that the page's own `parseManifest` accepts every subreddit in it (one it ignores would quietly send those scans to the API); that a range preflight passes from every origin in `tools/r2-cors.json` and fails from others (so that file is checked against the bucket, not just recorded); and that each file answers a range request with 206, its full size in `Content-Range`, CORS, `Content-Range` exposed, and no `Content-Encoding`.
- Files are Snappy-compressed (hyparquet reads Snappy with no extra package) in ~10k-row groups. Measured on r/Hasan_Piker (131k posts, 792k comments): 1.3 MB, 5.8 MB and 10.6 MB; one user's comments read 71 KB and a 1,922-comment thread 285 KB, plus a 64 KB footer read.
- For the browser, [hyparquet](https://github.com/hyparam/hyparquet) skips row groups by min/max statistics only for operator filters: `filter: { author: { $eq: name } }`. A plain `{ author: name }` gives the right rows but reads the whole file. Pass `initialFetchSize: 64 * 1024` to `parquetMetadataAsync`; the default reads the last 512 KB.
