# Archive runbook

This is how the R2 archive (bucket `rpp-db`, served at https://rpp-db.tinted979.dev) is kept current, and what to do when something needs a hand.
- **Why it's built this way:** docs/adr/0004 (a static archive), 0005 (its scheduled sync) and 0006 (counts stop at the post).
- **What each tool does:** `.claude/rules/archive.md`.

## What runs

- **Hourly, `.github/workflows/archive-sync.yml`**, while `ARCHIVE_SYNC_ENABLED` is `true` (on since 2026-09-26; see "Pausing").
  - **Each run:** for every subreddit in `tools/archive.json` that's due, it:
    1. fetches what's new from Arctic Shift;
    2. splices that onto the live build and publishes a new build;
    3. deletes builds that were replaced at least 72 h ago.
  - **Each week,** each subreddit re-fetches its last 7 days, to catch items Arctic Shift archived late.
  - **The token:** only one step of one job, `publish`, sees it. That step runs only shell: rclone, curl, sha256sum and standard tools.
- **Weekly, `.github/workflows/archive-check.yml`:** checks the archive serves the page what it needs (the manifest, CORS, range reads).
- **By hand:** first imports of big subreddits, and the jobs below.

## Setting up the sync (once)

1. **Make a token for the bucket only.**
   - In Cloudflare, go to R2 → Manage API tokens → Create API token, with Object Read & Write, applied to `rpp-db` only.
   - Keep three things: the access key id, the secret, and the account's S3 endpoint, `https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`.
2. **Make the `archive` environment.** On GitHub, go to Settings → Environments → New environment, and call it `archive`.
   - **Deployment branches and tags:** choose "Selected branches and tags" and add `main`, so no other branch can run with the token.
   - **Environment secrets:** add `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `R2_ENDPOINT`, only after the branch rule above is saved.
   - **Never add them as repository secrets.** Secrets with the same names at the repository level would reach any branch, where the `main`-only rule wouldn't cover them.
   - **Required reviewers:** none, since it runs hourly.
3. **Do a dry run.** Go to Actions → Sync the archive → Run workflow, on `main`, with mode `dry-run`.
   - It calls Arctic Shift, fetches and builds, but publishes nothing.
   - The build job's summary lists what it built and what it skipped.
4. **Do one real run for one subreddit:** mode `sync`, subreddit `Hasan_Piker`. Then check from your machine:
   - `tools/check_dumps.sh all` passes;
   - the manifest's `comments_to_utc` is within about an hour of now.
5. **Turn the schedule on.** Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables, and set `ARCHIVE_SYNC_ENABLED` to `true`.

## Reading a run

The build job's summary has:
- a line for each subreddit it built: the mode, and the posts and comments fetched;
- a line for each subreddit it skipped, and why;
- the pages fetched, and whether Arctic Shift was busy.

| You see | It means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `not due` | Its cadence hasn't passed yet. | Nothing. |
| `Arctic Shift was busy` | A fetch got "slow down" or 429 replies, so the run stopped fetching. It never retries harder. | Nothing: the next run tries again. |
| `the run budget … is spent` | `run_budget` pages were used up, so the rest wait for the next run. | Nothing, unless it keeps happening. Then raise `run_budget` modestly: Arctic Shift is a free, shared service. |
| `… is earlier than the live build's … cutoff` | The fetch stopped short of the live build's cutoff (its budget, or an error), so the live build stays. | If it keeps happening for one subreddit, it's too busy for the budget: raise `budget`, or make its cadence shorter so each run has less to fetch. |
| `isn't in the archive yet` | It's listed, but has no build and no `"backfill": "api"`. | Import it (below). |
| publish: `the live manifest changed since this bundle was made` | Another upload (yours, say) landed between build and publish. | Nothing: the next run builds from the new manifest. |
| publish: `not every build due was pruned` | The new build is live, but the builds named above it weren't deleted. They're recorded as pruned and won't be tried again. The run's later bundles aren't published and `verify` doesn't run; the next run builds them again. | Delete them by hand if you like (see "Builds on R2"). |
| verify fails | The new build is live, but the page may not read it right. | Run `tools/check_dumps.sh` yourself, and see the Hosting notes in `.claude/rules/archive.md`. |

## Adding a subreddit

- **A small one** (up to a few thousand items a day, with little history):
  - Add `"Name": {"cadence": "1h", "backfill": "api"}` to `tools/archive.json` and merge.
  - The sync then builds it from its start over several runs, `budget` pages at a time, after the subreddits that are caught up.
  - That's a lot of requests to a free service, so import anything big instead.
- **A big one** (r/Hasan_Piker's history is about 16k pages): import it.
  1. Get its posts and comments as JSONL, either:
     - **from the lake** (below), in minutes and with no requests to Arctic Shift: `uv run tools/reddit_lake.py extract --root F:/reddit --subreddits Name --out F:/new_dumps`. It refuses a lake with a month missing, and warns if the subreddit's history may start before the lake's first month;
     - **or with Arctic Shift's download tool** (https://arctic-shift.photon-reddit.com/download-tool), which pages the API: hours for a big subreddit.
  2. `uv run tools/build_dumps.py --subreddit Name --posts r_Name_posts.jsonl --comments r_Name_comments.jsonl --out dumps-new`
  3. `tools/upload_dumps.sh dumps-new --only name`. This publishes just that subreddit into the live manifest, and every other entry stays as it is.
  4. Add it to `tools/archive.json`, without `backfill`, and merge. The sync takes it on from its cutoff.

  A build from the lake ends where the lake does (the last monthly dump); the sync's first run fetches from there to now, over a few runs if it's weeks behind.

  The download tool starts each page at the last item's time. So an item that shares its second with the end of a page can go missing, and the weekly repair only reaches 7 days back. That's a handful of items, too few to change counts.
- **Stopping one:** take it out of `tools/archive.json`.
  - Its live build then stays in the manifest, still correct up to its cutoff, and the page still uses it for scans before that.
  - To drop it from the manifest too, make a whole upload with `--drop key`, from a directory that holds the live `manifest.json` and every other subreddit's live build. A whole upload refuses a stale build whose cutoff is older than the live one's ("is earlier than the live build's"); `--allow-older` overrides that.

## The monthly dumps (the lake)

Arctic Shift publishes all of Reddit as one torrent a month (https://github.com/ArthurHeitmann/arctic_shift/blob/master/download_links.md): `RC_YYYY-MM.zst` (comments) and `RS_YYYY-MM.zst` (posts), about 75 GB a month now, 4.4 TB for 2005 to 2025. `tools/reddit_lake.py` keeps them under one folder (`--root`, F:/reddit for now):
- **`raw/`:** the dumps as downloaded, in any subfolders. Never changed or deleted: they're the only full copy, and everything else is rebuilt from them.
- **`lake/`:** each month as Parquet parts sorted by subreddit then time, with the fields worth querying (text included), and `months.json`, what's been converted. A subreddit is then a quick query, never a download.

**Each month:**
1. `uv run tools/reddit_lake.py status --root F:/reddit --releases` lists the released months you haven't downloaded, with magnet links. Download them into `raw/`. Months before 2024-04 come only in the combined torrents it lists last; a torrent client can pick single months' files from those.
2. `uv run tools/reddit_lake.py update --root F:/reddit` converts every downloaded month that isn't in the lake yet: about 35–60 minutes for a recent month (an estimate, to be measured).
   - It's safe to run again: finished months are skipped, and one cut off partway is redone.
   - A file that's still downloading, or damaged, is reported and left out ("ends partway through"), and the rest go in. Run it again once the download finishes.
   - It works in `lake/.tmp` (a few GB), on the lake's drive.
3. Nothing else: the sync keeps the archived subreddits current from the API. The lake is for adding subreddits, and whatever gets built on it later.

**If something's wrong:** `status` also lists months missing between the first and last (`gap:`), files held twice (keep one), and files still downloading. To redo a month, delete its folders under `lake/comments/` and `lake/posts/` and its entry in `lake/months.json`, then run `update`. A new lake schema (`SCHEMA` in the tool) means moving `lake/` aside and converting again from `raw/`.

## Forcing a run

Dispatch the workflow on `main`:
- **`plan`:** says what's due, without fetching anything;
- **`dry-run`:** builds without publishing;
- **`sync`:** builds and publishes.

With a subreddit named, it builds just that one, due or not. Tick "repair" to re-fetch its last `repair_days`. `budget` overrides the pages per fetch.

## Pausing

- **Scheduled runs:** set `ARCHIVE_SYNC_ENABLED` to anything but `true`. Dispatches still work.
- **Everything:** disable the workflow on the Actions tab.
- **After 60 days** without repository activity, GitHub disables scheduled workflows. Re-enable it on the Actions tab.

## Builds on R2

- **The publish log:** each publish is logged in `r/<key>/published.json`, a public file listing which build it replaced and when.
- **Pruning:**
  - A build is deleted by the first publish at least 72 h after the one that replaced it, at most 5 per publish. `publish_build.sh` checks the 72 h against R2's own log, not only the bundle's list.
  - Never deleted: a build a manifest names, or one the log doesn't know.
- **Builds the log doesn't know** are only reported: a publish that prunes lists them as "neither live nor in the publish log". Examples:
  - hand uploads from before the sync;
  - a publish that uploaded its files and then stopped.

  To deal with one:
  1. List a subreddit's builds: `rclone lsf --dirs-only r2:rpp-db/r/<key>/`.
  2. Check that neither the live manifest (`curl -s "https://rpp-db.tinted979.dev/manifest.json?check=$(date +%s)"`, past the edge cache) nor anything you're about to upload names it.
  3. Delete it: `rclone purge r2:rpp-db/r/<key>/<version>`.
- **A half-finished upload:** both `upload_dumps.sh` and the sync upload build files first and the manifest last. So a stop in between leaves unreferenced files, which does no harm.
  - Running it again refuses the same version: a whole upload with "already exists on R2", an `--only` run or a sync publish with "already on R2". Rebuild with a new `--version`, or let the next sync run do it.

## Rotating the token

1. Make a new token, as in setup step 1.
2. Replace the three `archive` environment secrets. Also update your own rclone config: `rclone config update r2 access_key_id=… secret_access_key=…`.
3. Dispatch a `sync`, or wait for the next run, and check that it publishes.
4. Revoke the old token in Cloudflare.

## Updating rclone and duckdb

- **Actions** in the workflows are pinned to commits, and Dependabot bumps them.
- **rclone** (the publish job) and **duckdb** (the build job) are pinned in `archive-sync.yml` and bumped by hand.
  - **For rclone,** set `RCLONE_VERSION` and `RCLONE_SHA256`. The checksum is the `rclone-v<version>-linux-amd64.zip` line of the release's SHA256SUMS: `gh release download v<version> -R rclone/rclone -p SHA256SUMS -O -`. Download the zip and check it with `sha256sum` too.
  - **For duckdb,** set `DUCKDB_VERSION`, and run the tool tests with that version first: `uv run --with "duckdb==<version>" --with pytest --with zstandard pytest tools`.

## Updating hyparquet

`web/hyparquet.js` is hyparquet's jsDelivr `+esm` build, saved with its license header added. It's never edited, and it's a protected file (`ack:sensitive`).
- **Where it comes from:** `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hyparquet@<version>/+esm`. The version is in the header, currently 1.31.1.
- **To check the saved copy against its source** (this prints nothing when they match):

  ```sh
  diff <(tail -n +11 web/hyparquet.js | tr -d '\r') \
       <(curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hyparquet@1.31.1/+esm | grep -v '^//# sourceMappingURL=')
  ```

  For 1.31.1, the code after the header hashes to `4d7f0e1897f7f69924dceac300a477b855ec4a1c257c82cafce15b1f2b701872` (`tail -n +11 web/hyparquet.js | tr -d '\r' | sha256sum`). Checked 2026-09-26.
- **To update:**
  1. Download the new version's `+esm` and drop its `sourceMappingURL` line.
  2. Put the license header back, with the new version.
  3. Run the web tests, and try a scan in the browser.
