# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Reddit Post Profiler (RPP). Profiles everyone who commented on a Reddit post using the [Arctic Shift](https://github.com/ArthurHeitmann/arctic_shift/blob/master/api/README.md) archive API. It reports:

- each commenter's posts and comments in the post's subreddit *before* the post was created;
- their per-subreddit activity everywhere, also up to the post: every count stops at the post (docs/adr/0006).

It's a web app in `web/`: plain ES modules with no build step and no runtime dependencies, deployed to GitHub Pages. (The tests have one dev dependency, fake-indexeddb.) Results download as a CSV (`toCsv`, one row per user and subreddit). There's no server and no other implementation.

## Commands

```sh
cd web && npm ci && npm test              # web tests: node --test (Node 22+, pinned in web/.nvmrc); npm ci once, for fake-indexeddb
cd web && node --test --test-name-pattern="Eta" tests/core.test.js   # single web test
python3 -m http.server -d web             # serve the web app locally (ES modules need http)
uv run tools/build_dumps.py --subreddit X --posts X_posts.jsonl --comments X_comments.jsonl   # build dump files into dumps/
uv run tools/build_dumps.py --subreddit X --posts new_p.jsonl --comments new_c.jsonl --splice live --cut <epoch> --posts-through <epoch> --comments-through <epoch> --out live   # splice fetched rows onto a downloaded live build
tools/upload_dumps.sh [dumps] [--drop KEY]   # check against what's live, upload dumps/ to R2 (rclone remote "r2"), check the public URL
tools/upload_dumps.sh [dumps] --only KEY [--allow-older]   # just r/KEY's build, into the live manifest (merge-one, then publish_build.sh): other subreddits stay as they're live
uv run tools/check_upload.py merge-one --key x --dumps dumps --live live.json --log published.json --out bundle   # one subreddit's build, merged into the live manifest and checked, ready to publish (no token)
tools/publish_build.sh bundle   # publish that bundle to R2: the one step that holds the token (rclone, curl and sha256sum only)
uv run tools/reddit_lake.py update --root F:/reddit   # convert newly downloaded monthly dumps (raw/) into the lake (lake/); status [--releases] says what's there and what to download
uv run tools/reddit_lake.py extract --root F:/reddit --subreddits X,Y --out DIR   # a subreddit's posts and comments from the lake as JSONL, for build_dumps.py (local, no API)
uv run tools/archive_sync.py plan   # which subreddits in tools/archive.json are due for the archive sync (reads the public archive only)
uv run tools/archive_sync.py build --out DIR [--only X]   # the sync's build job: fetch, splice, and bundles in DIR/bundles for publish_build.sh (fetches call the live API: not from tests or agents)
tools/check_dumps.sh [all|manifest|cors|files]  # check the live archive serves the page right (no credentials; CI runs it weekly and after each sync publish)
node tools/fetch_subreddit.mjs --subreddit X --kind comments --after <epoch> --budget 50 --out c.jsonl --result c.json   # the sync's fetcher (calls the live API: never from tests or agents)
node tools/lifetime_bench.mjs --post <url> [--out bench.json]   # P8: one interactions query vs the two aggregates, per commenter (calls the live API: the owner runs it)
uv run --with duckdb --with pytest --with zstandard pytest tools   # dump tool tests (CI runs them too)
bash .github/scripts/rule-guards.sh              # the Rules for changes a grep can decide (CI runs it)
node --test .github/scripts/tests/*.test.mjs      # tests of the CI scripts
node web/bench/scan-bench.mjs [--base <git-ref>]   # offline scan benchmark: requests by endpoint, archive reads/bytes, simulated seconds; no network
```

There is no linter or formatter for the code; CI lints only shell scripts (shellcheck) and workflows (actionlint, zizmor).

## How changes reach `main`

- Everything lands through a pull request into `main`, and merging deploys to GitHub Pages. Only the owner merges: rulesets require green `checks / test` and `checks / guards` (no bypass), and a code-owner approval that no bot or token can give (the owner bypasses it only for their own PRs). Agents can't push to the owner's branches.
- CI (`ci.yml` calling `checks.yml`) runs the tests, the grep-able rules (`.github/scripts/rule-guards.sh`) and, on PRs, the guards (`pr-guards.sh`, from the base branch): agent work may never touch `.github/`, `.claude/`, CLAUDE.md, `web/hyparquet.js`, `tools/r2-cors.json` or `tools/publish_build.sh` (which holds the R2 token in the archive sync), and the owner's own changes there need the `ack:sensitive` label. Tests removed or skipped, and agent changes to existing tests or to what decides which tests run, need `ack:tests`; more than 600 changed lines need `ack:large`.
- Agents: read-only reviewers comment on PRs (`agent-review.yml`); writers turn an issue the owner labels `agent:implement` or `agent:refactor` into a draft PR (`agent-write.yml`, with the owner's writer app); audits file at most three findings as issues (`agent-audit.yml`). Roles are `.claude/agents/*.md`; the repository variable `AGENTS_ENABLED` switches them all off.
- The details (workflows, rulesets, the path hook, the writer app, what each guard checks) load from `.claude/rules/ci-and-agents.md` when you open a file under `.github/` or `.claude/`. The design and its reasons are in `WORKFLOW.md`.

## Web app map

Detail for each module loads from `.claude/rules/` when you open its files. Every module but `app.js` has no DOM access.

- **`core.js`:** `ArcticShiftClient` (pacing, AIMD backoff, `meta-app`), commenters, a covered subreddit's tail (`fetchTails`, once per scan), `buildProfile` (lifetime counts and "before" facts, from the API or the archive), badges, scan estimates, CSV and saved-scan files, `Eta`. No DOM. (`web-core.md`, and the verified API behaviour in `arctic-shift-api.md`.)
- **`cache.js`:** IndexedDB `reddit-tool` with the `counts` (`ProfileCache`) and `scans` (`ScanStore`) stores; **`queue.js`:** `LinkQueue` in localStorage, run by one tab at a time. (`web-storage.md`.)
- **`dumps.js`:** `DumpSource`, the per-subreddit Parquet archive on R2, read with hyparquet range requests, and `TailStore`, the tab's tails of activity after the files end; **`hyparquet.js`:** a saved copy, never edited; **`tools/`:** fetches for, builds, uploads and checks the archive, and keeps a local lake of the monthly dumps it can be built from, which `archive-sync.yml` keeps current, each subreddit on its cadence in `tools/archive.json` (`docs/archive-runbook.md`). (`archive.md`.)
- **`options.js`** (scan options and share links), **`format.js`** (text helpers), **`app.js`** (the DOM only: runs, cards, the scheduler, saved scans). (`web-app.md`.)

## Rules for changes

The AI pull request reviewers (`.github/workflows/agent-review.yml`, roles in `.claude/agents/`) check changes against this file, so these are the rules to hold to:

- **Stale runs:** anything async in `app.js` that touches shared state or the page after an `await` must check its `runId` (or `state.controller`) first.
- **Stored data:** bump the cache key version (`v2|life|…`, `v2|before|…`) when a stored value's shape changes, and never rename the `reddit-tool` IndexedDB database or the `reddit-tool-*` localStorage keys: visitors would lose their saved scans, results, queue and badge settings (docs/adr/0003).
- **Untrusted input:** API responses, the archive manifest and imported saved-scan files are untrusted. Put text in with `textContent`/`el()`, never `innerHTML`; build links from a fixed `https://` prefix with each name `encodeURIComponent`-ed (`redditPostUrl`, `redditSubredditUrl`) or `URLSearchParams`; validate imported fields as `importScan` does (it also renumbers ranks, which index the page's card slots).
- **Content-Security-Policy:** `index.html` has a meta CSP: only the site's own scripts and styles, `connect-src` limited to Arctic Shift and the archive host, a `blob:` worker. A new host the page fetches from goes in `connect-src` (a test in `dumps.test.js` checks it against `BASE_URL`/`DUMPS_URL`); don't add `'unsafe-inline'` or `'unsafe-eval'`.
- **Imports:** keep local imports as `from "./x.js"` (the deploy step's cache busting rewrites exactly that form), and add any new file type to the deploy copy step (docs/adr/0001).
- **The API:** Arctic Shift is a free shared service. New requests go through `ArcticShiftClient._get` (pacing, backoff, `meta-app`); don't add request patterns that bypass its throttle, and don't fall back to heavier queries when the server is busy or rate-limiting (docs/adr/0002).
- **Accessibility:** keep keyboard focus somewhere sensible when elements hide, announce milestones through `#announce` rather than every tick, and keep colour pairs at 4.5:1 or better.
- **Tests:** logic in `core.js`, `cache.js`, `queue.js`, `dumps.js`, `options.js` and `format.js` gets a test in `web/tests/` (storage behaviour in `tests/cache.test.js`, which runs against both `MemoryBackend` and the real `IndexedDbBackend` on fake-indexeddb), so logic that needs no DOM goes in one of those rather than `app.js`; `npm test` must pass. Numbers in `index.html`'s help text that come from a constant are marked `<span data-const="NAME">`, and `tests/page.test.js` checks them (and the history-window options) against the code.
- **Dump tools:** builds are never overwritten (a new build gets a new `r/<sub>/<version>/`), and no tool but `publish_build.sh`'s prune step deletes one. It deletes a build only when the publish log on R2 says it was replaced at least 72 h ago, and neither the old nor the new manifest names it; builds the log doesn't know are reported, and removed only by hand (`docs/archive-runbook.md`) (docs/adr/0005); bump `FORMAT` in `build_dumps.py` and `DUMP_FORMAT` in `dumps.js` together, page first, when the files' columns, sort order or the manifest's shape change; keep each file sorted by its lookup key (hyparquet skips row groups by min/max); and keep `upload_dumps.sh`'s order (preflight, build files, checks, then the manifest) and `publish_build.sh`'s (the live manifest unchanged, no existing build, build files, checks, the live manifest still unchanged, the manifest, the publish log, then any prunes). `publish_build.sh` holds the R2 token in the sync, so it stays shell (rclone, curl, sha256sum and standard tools: coreutils, grep, sed, find) with no Node or Python, and checks every name in its bundle before any rclone call. Tool logic gets a pytest test in `tools/tests/` (the Node tools' are in `web/tests/`, `fetch-subreddit.test.js` and `lifetime-bench.test.js`, so `npm test` runs them). `tools/tests/test_contract.py` (and `test_contract_threads.py`, for `comments_by_link`) rebuilds the page's committed fixtures (`web/tests/fixtures/dumps`, from `dumps-src/`) and checks them and `web/dumps.js` (format, file names, columns) against the script; when it fails, rebuild the fixtures as its message says and update `dumps.js` to match (docs/adr/0005).
- **Git workflow:** for any code change, create a `claude/<topic>` branch before editing, with a topic that doesn't start with a digit (CI writers use `claude/<issue>-<slug>`, and the rulesets tell the two apart by that). When the work is done and `npm test` passes, commit, push, and open a PR into `main` with `gh pr create`, its body following `.github/pull_request_template.md`. Never push to `main` directly or merge PRs yourself. Never edit an existing test to make it pass; say in the PR if a test looks wrong.

## Backlog and decisions

- Known debt is GitHub issues labelled `debt`; agent findings are labelled `agent:finding`. Before refactoring or cleanup, check whether an issue covers it, and close it from the PR (`Closes #N`). File newly found debt as a `debt` issue.
- Lasting decisions are in `docs/adr/` (no build step or dependencies, Arctic Shift etiquette, frozen storage names, the static archive and its scheduled sync, every count stopping at the post, one `interactions` query for lifetime counts); the `adr` skill says how to add one.
- Live browser checks: the `live-browser-test` skill.
